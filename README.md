# House Price Prediction Model

This project builds a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like area, location, number of bedrooms, and amenities. It uses a Gradient Boosting Regressor to estimate prices with good accuracy.

> **Note**: Due to the large size of the dataset, the raw data files are not uploaded to this repository.  
> **Data Source**: [Housing data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/housing-prices-in-metropolitan-areas-of-indi) 

⚠️ The model performs reasonably well overall, but the accuracy can vary and may be inconsistent for some price ranges.
